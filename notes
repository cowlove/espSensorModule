BROKEN:  
If --fail espnow is set high enough, some of 3 three csim clients get zero traffic through. 
Probably a simulation artifact.  Probably would help if all csim espnowmux clients got 
a copy of every traffic, rather than stealing it from each other all the time 
! 
./csim --fail espnow=.3 | grep MAC3
