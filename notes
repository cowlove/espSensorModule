TODO: working on csim contexts, kinda works.  Seems context isn't yet in place
for the constructors 


BROKEN:  
If --fail espnow is set high enough, some of 3 three csim clients get zero traffic through. 
Probably a simulation artifact.  Probably would help if all csim espnowmux clients got 
a copy of every traffic, rather than stealing it from each other all the time 

TODO:  Handle optional startup delay for reading dht sensor if using a gpio pin as VCC

./csim --fail espnow=.3 | grep MAC3 

#notes on building with esp32 3.2.0 and espMakeArduino:
need to checkout own version of ESP_ROOT to ~/esp32
need to edit out 0xD100 line from boards.txt
need to explicitly specify libraries
